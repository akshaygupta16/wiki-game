# Wikipedia Game

A Python Wikipedia Game solver. Wikipedia Game rules: navigate from a specified starting Wikipedia page to a specified goal page by clicking Wikipedia links within the articles. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game)

This project was intended to give me a quick way to practice applying the paradigms I learned in my data structures and algorithms class (CS 61B) to a fun problem in Python. Despite the speed limitations of the Wikipedia API (see Experimentations.ipynb), I decided to continue with this project for this reason.
